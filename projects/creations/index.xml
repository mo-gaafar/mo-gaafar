This initiative is not just a testament to technological innovation but also a beacon of hope for individuals suffering from the debilitating effects of stroke and brain injuries. We invite esteemed colleagues and professors to explore the nuances and progress of our endeavor as we apply for further study and research opportunities.</description></item></channel></rss>
