**Building the CUERT Website with Hugo and Netlify CMS**

As web development team leader for the Cairo University Eco-Racing Team (CUERT), I wanted to create a website that reflects our innovative spirit and showcases our dedication to sustainable transportation. I chose Hugo and Netlify CMS as the foundation for the project. Here's why:

* **Speed and Performance:** Hugo is renowned for its blazingly fast performance, making it ideal for building websites that deliver a great user experience.
* **Developer-Friendly:** As a developer myself, I appreciate Hugo's simplicity and flexibility. It gave me full control to customize the site's structure, design, and functionality to our specific needs.
* **Content Management Made Easy:** Netlify CMS offers a streamlined way to manage and update website content without needing in-depth coding knowledge. This was important for us since non-technical team members also need to contribute to the website.

**Project Walkthrough**

Here's a quick overview of the steps involved in building the CUERT website:

1. **Designing the Structure:** I sketched out the desired website structure and information flow, keeping in mind user experience and the team's goals. 
2. **Setting up Hugo:** Installing Hugo and selecting an appropriate theme to kick-start development was a breeze.

Building this website was a fantastic learning experience. If you're looking for a powerful and flexible website development solution, I recommend exploring Hugo and Netlify CMS.
