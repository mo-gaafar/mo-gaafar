This review delves into the pioneering integration of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technologies in neuromotor rehabilitation. Highlighting a significant leap in the realm of therapeutic interventions, the paper, titled "Immersive Virtual Reality Games in Neuromotor Rehabilitation with Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Scoping Review," encapsulates an extensive synthesis of current research, offering a comprehensive understanding of the field's trajectory and potential.

Key takeaways include:

* **Demographic Diversity and Wide Age Range**: The studies encompass a broad demographic, underscoring VR and BCI's potential across various age groups and health conditions, particularly emphasizing the inclusion of stroke and cerebral palsy patients.
* **Technological Evolution**: A shift from traditional CAVE systems to the Oculus Rift marks a significant technological advancement, reflecting user preference and accessibility.
* **Motor Imagery (MI) Paradigm**: The unanimous adoption of MI across studies accentuates its critical role in enhancing neuroplasticity and improving rehabilitation outcomes.
* **Design and Engagement**: The diverse game design elements, focusing on scoring, embodiment, and customization, demonstrate the versatility of immersive BCI-VR games in addressing motor impairments and engaging users.
* **Future Directions**: While revealing promising results, the review also identifies areas needing attention, such as the limited focus on gamification and the predominance of healthy participants, suggesting a pathway for more inclusive and engaging future research.
