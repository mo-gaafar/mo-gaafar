[{"categories":null,"contents":"In the quest to enhance neurorehabilitation, our team at Cairo University, is pioneering a project that integrates the immersive world of Virtual Reality (VR) with the groundbreaking potential of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. This initiative is not just a testament to technological innovation but also a beacon of hope for individuals suffering from the debilitating effects of stroke and brain injuries. We invite esteemed colleagues and professors to explore the nuances and progress of our endeavor as we apply for further study and research opportunities.\nGlobally, stroke and brain injuries are leading causes of severe motor disabilities, leaving millions in need of effective rehabilitation strategies. Traditional therapies often fall short in providing the engagement and individual adaptation necessary for optimal recovery. Our project is born from the urgent need for solutions that are not only effective but also personalized and engaging, using VR and BCI as tools to revolutionize the recovery process.\nAt the heart of our initiative is the synergy between VR and BCI technologies. We are developing an immersive VR game that simulates hiking and other walking activities, designed to motivate and engage users in a compelling rehabilitation journey. The key to this immersive experience is the integration of a Brain-Computer Interface system, which we are currently in the research phase of developing. Our focus is on designing robust motor imagery classifiers that will accurately interpret the user\u0026rsquo;s intentions, translating thoughts into real-time feedback within the virtual environment, thereby enhancing neuroplasticity and functional recovery.\nA critical element of our BCI system is the OpenBCI Cyton board, an adaptable and powerful tool for biosignal processing. We recently discovered a Cyton board in the rehabilitation lab at Cairo University, and we are in the process of repairing and customizing it to fit our project\u0026rsquo;s needs. This endeavor exemplifies our commitment to resourcefulness and innovation, utilizing available technology to its fullest potential.\nTo give a glimpse into the future,here is a generative AI-created image depicting our envisioned VR game design.\nPlaceholder for Image: Generative AI Image of VR Game Design\nWhile we navigate the complexities of developing accurate motor imagery classifiers and integrating them with the VR environment, we are also dedicated to ensuring user comfort and adapting the system to individual needs. Our commitment extends beyond technological innovation; we are focused on creating a solution that is accessible, effective, and user-centered. For that we have used a 3D printed prototype that will fit well with VR headsets and also provide us with good signal quality from the motor cortex area. This uses the OpenBCI snap EEG electrodes along with any standard 3.5mm electrode clip.\nOur project is a journey of innovation, collaboration, and determination. As we continue to make strides in VR and BCI integration for neurorehabilitation, we invite our academic and professional community to join us in this exciting venture. Your insights, critiques, and support are crucial as we strive to transform the landscape of rehabilitation for individuals affected by stroke and brain injuries.\nWe welcome discussions, feedback, and collaborations from experts and enthusiasts alike. If you wish to learn more, contribute your expertise, or explore potential research collaborations, please reach out. Together, we can make a significant impact on the future of neurorehabilitation.\n","permalink":"https://www.mngaafar.com/projects/creations/advancing-neurorehabilitation-integrating-brain-computer-interfaces-in-virtual-reality-for-motor-rehabilitation-of-stroke-patients/","tags":["graduation_project"],"title":"Advancing Neurorehabilitation: Integrating Brain Computer Interfaces in Virtual Reality for Motor Rehabilitation of Stroke Patients"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This review delves into the pioneering integration of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technologies in neuromotor rehabilitation.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","permalink":"https://www.mngaafar.com/blog/force-ssl/","tags":["apache","apache","redirect","rewrite","ssl","web development"],"title":"My first blog post"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /resume URL with the related resume layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/resume.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThe canva link is used to embed the resume in the website.\n","permalink":"https://www.mngaafar.com/resume/","tags":null,"title":"Resume"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JSON\u0026#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026#34;contents\u0026#34;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
